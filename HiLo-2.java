/* SELF ASSESSMENT
   1. Did I use appropriate CONSTANTS instead of numbers within the code?
       Mark out of 5: 5 
       Comment: Constants were used instead of numbers where appropriate.
   2. Did I use easy-to-understand, meaningful CONSTANT names formatted correctly in UPPERCASE?
       Mark out of 5: 5
       Comment: All constants have reasonable, understandable names.
   3. Did I use easy-to-understand meaningful variable names?
       Mark out of 10: 10
       Comment: Variables names are clear.
   4. Did I format the variable names properly (in lowerCamelCase)?
       Mark out of 5: 5 
       Comment: All variables are in lowerCamelCase
   5. Did I indent the code appropriately?
       Mark out of 10: 10
       Comment: Code is indented correctly.
   6. Did I use an appropriate loop to allow the user to enter their guesses until they win or lose?
       Mark out of 20: 
       Comment: 
   7. Did I check the input to ensure that invalid input was handled appropriately?
       Mark out of 10: 
       Comment: 
   8. Did I generate the cards properly using random number generation (assuming all cards are equally likely each time)?
       Mark out of 10: 
       Comment: 
   9. Did I output the cards correctly as 2, 3, 4, ... 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King?
       Mark out of 10: 
       Comment: 
   10. Did I report whether the user won or lost the game before the program finished?

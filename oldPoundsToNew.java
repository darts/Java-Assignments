 /*  SELF ASSESSMENT
   1. Did I use appropriate CONSTANTS instead of numbers within the code?
       Mark out of 10:	10, the original constants and the ones used in the code are defined.  
   2. Did I use easy-to-understand, meaningful CONSTANT names?
       Mark out of 5:	5, they seem to be fairly self-explanatory. 
    3. Did I format the CONSTANT names properly (in UPPERCASE)?
       Mark out of 5:	5, all constants are in uppercase.
   4. Did I use easy-to-understand meaningful variable names?
       Mark out of 10:	9, I'd say they're pretty good.
   5. Did I format the variable names properly (in lowerCamelCase)?
       Mark out of 10:	10, all variables are formatted in lowerCamelCase.
   6. Did I indent the code appropriately?
       Mark out of 10:	10
   7. Did I read the input correctly from the user using (an) appropriate question(s)?
       Mark out of 10:  8, the question could be more clear.
   8. Did I compute the answer correctly for all cases?
       Mark out of 20:  15, no, given a large enough number the program will return an incorrect answer, 
       						however (usually) if the user follows instructions (and sometimes even when
       						they don't) it should return the correct answer.
   9. Did I output the correct answer in the correct format (as shown in the examples)?
       Mark out of 10:  10, the output was formatted correctly.
   10. How well did I complete this self-assessment?
       Mark out of 10:  7, I felt like I was being too generous.
   Total Mark out of 100 (Add all the previous marks):  89
